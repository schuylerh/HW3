# Assignment Description
This file documents my usage of an LLM to explore the topic of the influence of different programming paradigms on the development of modern programming languages.

# LLM Literature Review

## What are the key differences between these paradigms, and how do they affect language design choices?

ChatGPT4's Response:
>Procedural Languages prioritize linear execution and straightforward procedures, leading to languages that are simple and close to hardware but may require more effort to manage complex systems.
>
>Object-Oriented Languages focus on modeling real-world entities and their interactions, resulting in languages that support encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to manage complexity in large software systems.
>
>Functional Languages emphasize immutability and pure functions, leading to languages that facilitate reasoning about code behavior, enable easier parallelization, and reduce side effects.
